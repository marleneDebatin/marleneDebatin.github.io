                  Welcome! This is my website. It doesn't really have a purpose other than being a website. I just want to code something and try out diffrent designs. I could not develop the design following the content, so the content had to follow the design. right now, the website is in a very early state without a real concept, so the content is pretty plain as well. I have lots of ideas in my mind, too many. I have not yet decided which one I will finally choose.
            </p>
            <p>
                  So I will just go ahead and tell you something about myself. As you have probably noticed, I like the Englisch language. I am from Germany and have been living in Germany my entire live. Tough, this text is written in Englisch. I do not expect any international readers in the future, but I write in Englisch none the less. I just like it better than German. So please, excuse my mistakes. Englisch is still not a native language for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                  Currently, I'm in school. I really like learning. You can put me in a museum with an audiogiude and can be sure not to see me for the next hour. Even if the exhibition is about medival history. I really dont't like medival history. Seeing that I like learning, you could conclude that I like school as well. And I do. I might be the type of student who complains about wanting to go home all day long, but during the lessons, I am always active and following. My problems is the organisations, the lack of choice for the students regarding subjects and topics and the lack of inovation regarding teaching mediums.
            </p>
            <p>
                  So I have turned to the internet. On the internet, I have an overbaording amount of content to explore. Currently, I am focusing on web design and font-end development. I have gained some knowledge and some skills, but there is still a lot to be improved. Adn the learning opportunities are there. I just need the motivation and persistence to use them.
